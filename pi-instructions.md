Code Notes for weatherstation.c

    weatherstation.c is the main source file for our project today.
    Line 17: We set our Pico to read our DHT from GPIO15. You can set up multiple DHTâ€™s or change your GPIO pin here.
    Line 199-200: This printf statement is for troubleshooting purposes and can only be accessed via minicom. Accessing readings via minicom will be discussed in the troubleshooting section.
